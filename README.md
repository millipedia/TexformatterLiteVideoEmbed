# TexformatterLiteVideoEmbed
Processwire Textformatter to replace Youtube and Vimeo links with lite embed placeholders.

My plan is to update [jacmaes original text formatter](https://github.com/jacmaes/TextformatterLiteYouTubeEmbed) to include Vimeo lite ... but I haven't yet - it's still only youTube.

At the moment this still requires you to upload the scripts manually. Give me a poke if you're interested in using this and I'll get it updated.
